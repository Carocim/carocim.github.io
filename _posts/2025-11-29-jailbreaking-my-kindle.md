## Introduction

I resolved to read more books this year. For the past years, I have set myself back, reading only one or two books (sometimes none), and spent my time on things that contributed little to my knowledge. I looked back and realized I had an old Kindle lying around, waiting to be used. However, with a monopoly like Amazon, it is hard to truly own your books.

And so, I jailbroke my Kindle.

The spark came from a [random YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtk7ERwlIAk) that stumbled onto my feed. It looked intimidating at first; I had not jailbroken a device since an old iPhone 4s over a decade ago. But that is exactly where I found the excitement. It is like my old Kindle Basic Gen 10 has been fully resurfaced and brought back to life.

## Kindle Modding: Where to Start

If you find yourself wanting to jailbreak your own device, it is important to know that YouTube videos become outdated quickly. To keep up with the latest updates and safest procedures, always refer to actual documentation sites.

The official community resource is [https://kindlemodding.org/](https://kindlemodding.org/).

It takes no more than 15 minutes to jailbreak your Kindle, and every instruction and file you need is provided on the site. If you need general help, they also have an active Discord community ready to assist.

## What is in it? The Benefits of Ownership

The original Kindle Amazon UI is still available, but now you truly own your books and can sideload a variety of "apps" onto the device.

* **KOreader**: This is now your main reading program. It is also available for phones, allowing you to seamlessly sync your reading progress between devices. It has tons of customizations and requires minimal learning.

* **Open File Types**: No more strict book types. You can use standard EPUBs, PDFs, and others. You can drag and drop or wirelessly connect with Calibre, resulting in less hassle.

* **Community Apps**: The community makes specialized apps for the Kindle. I personally love KindleFetch, which lets you download your books directly via the Kindle without needing another device. There are even apps for Wordly, Tetris, and Anki for the Kindle, giving you the general idea of the possibilities.

## Tracking and The Impact

I use [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app) to integrate my reading progress. I find this better than Goodreads personally, though it still has room for improvement. Nonetheless, it keeps track of your books and helps your friends see what you are currently reading.

The jailbreaking process has made the Kindle feel new and has ignited my passion for reading again. I have read almost 30 books before this year ends, and I am not stopping. The device itself is comfortable to hold in one of my hands. I have been using it daily, often at night, leveraging the warm backlight and dark mode to sneak in a few chapters before sleep. I have got more books on my device now than I will be able to read for many, many months.
