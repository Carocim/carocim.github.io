Serves: 3  
Time: 15–20 mins  

## <span style="color: white;">Ingredients</span>

- 1 can Spam or Korean Chicken Luncheon Meat (Korean varieties are usually less salty)  
- 2 tbsp oyster sauce  
- 3 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp sugar  
- 3 eggs  
- Crushed nori  
- ~2 tsp butter  
- Kewpie mayo, to taste  
- 3 cups cooked rice  
- Optional: 2 tbsp sesame oil  

## <span style="color: white;">Steps</span>

1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and season with salt and pepper.  
2. In a separate bowl, mix 2 tbsp oyster sauce, 3 tbsp soy sauce, and ~3/4 cup water. Set aside.  
3. Cut the Spam/luncheon meat into cubes.  
4. Heat butter in a pan over low heat and cook the eggs until fluffy. Avoid overcooking. Set aside.  
5. In the same pan, fry the Spam/luncheon meat until fully cooked and nicely browned on the outside.  
6. Pour in the sauce mixture, ensuring every piece of Spam/luncheon meat is coated and glazed.  
7. Optional: Stir 2 tbsp sesame oil into the cooked rice for extra flavor.  

## <span style="color: white;">Serving</span>

- In a bowl, layer 1 cup of rice, scrambled eggs, cooked Spam/luncheon meat, and crushed nori.  
- Drizzle with Kewpie mayo to taste.  

## <span style="color: white;">Notes</span>

- Adjust the water, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar according to your preference.  
- I like it smoky and savory without being too salty so this combination works best for me, but feel free to tweak it!
