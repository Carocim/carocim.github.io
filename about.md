title: "About Me"

I honestly hate making "About Mes." Like all others, I'm still exploring myself and the realms of who I can be. But here is where the journey begins.

I'm Carocim. Professionally, I am a Medical Laboratory Scientist, applying a rigorous, analytical mind to the field of health. My passion, however, lies in learning to code, experimenting with tech, and building tools that I personally use.

My journey with GitHub began at the most unexpected time - right in the middle of reviewing for my local boards. I thought, "What's there to lose?" and started creating small tools to help with my daily grind: a pomodoro timer, a task list, and more. Anything digital that I can make my own excites me.

## Create, Not Just Consume

Like many, my attention is often split between the things I truly love (knowledge, books, video games, anime) and the unavoidable drag of brain rot and doomscrolling from social media.

This website, which I aim to call my personal digital area, is my defense against that passive consumption. It's a structured space designed to collect my thoughts, track my productivity, document my learning, and, hopefully, contribute to the world of knowledge if anyone ever stumbles upon this page.

## Goals Ahead

My immediate mission is to create more than I consume and to improve my writing. I am cultivating a new habit of reading research papers, creating structured notes, and writing articles. I know I'm not the best writer and feel like I'm behind, but this site is the dedicated space to progress, put my thoughts into words, and grow from there.
